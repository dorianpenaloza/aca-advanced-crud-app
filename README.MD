# CRUD Blog App
The CRUD app introduced me to the Create, Read, Update and Delete Cycle. These are the standard functions of a database. This app allows a user to:
Create a blog from a post form.
Read the blog's history from a collection of posts.
Update an existing post from a post_edit form.
Delete a post using a middleware called method-override for a DELETE request.


Using Model, View, Controller software design I learned to separate the apps logic. I also took advantage of semantic.js UI to style the app.

This node.js app is being hosted through Heroku: https://crud-apps.herokuapp.com/
